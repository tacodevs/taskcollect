NAME
    taskcollect - multiplex functionality from web platforms for students

INVOCATION
    taskcollect [-w]

DESCRIPTION
    TaskCollect starts a web server on TCP port 443 which provides a web
    interface for school students. The web interface provides functionality
    essential for student interaction with teacher-assigned resources, tasks,
    etc., communicating with users' schools' web platforms as necessary.

    TaskCollect also requires two WOFF2 font files, "mainfont.woff2" and
    "navfont.woff2". The main interface font (mainfont.woff2) is Lato Regular,
    while the navigation bar font (navbar.woff2) is Red Hat Display Medium. Both
    of these fonts files must be present in the resources folder.

OPTIONS
    -w    Run TaskCollect without TLS support. TaskCollect will start on port
          8080 and all connections will be bound to localhost to prevent
          unencrypted network connections.
