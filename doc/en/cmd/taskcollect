COMMANDS                                                             TASKCOLLECT

NAME
    taskcollect - multiplex functionality from web platforms for students

INVOCATION
    taskcollect [-w]

DESCRIPTION
    TaskCollect starts a web server on TCP port 443 which provides a web
    interface for school students. The web interface provides functionality
    essential for student interaction with teacher-assigned resources, tasks,
    etc., communicating with users' schools' web platforms as necessary.

    In order to write to the encrypted user credentials database, TaskCollect
    requests for the passphrase to the database before attempting to start the
    web server. If the credentials database is empty, TaskCollect will ask for
    a passphrase with which it will encrypt the database. TaskCollect will
    populate the database automatically so there is no need to manually create
    one, although an existing database can be imported. If TaskCollect is re-
    run with the same database or if a database is imported, TaskCollect must
    be provided with the correct passphrase to the credentials database.

    TaskCollect requires a Google OAuth 2.0 client ID file in order to
    authenticate to the Google Classroom API. An OAuth 2 client ID may be
    obtained from the Google Cloud Console with a valid Google account. The
    client ID must be made with the permitted access origin set to the server
    URL(s) (e.g. "https://taskcollect.io") and the redirect URL set to the
    server URL(s) with "/gauth" appended (e.g. "https://taskcollect.io/gauth").

    TaskCollect requires two TTF font files (for the "Lato" and "Red Hat
    Display" fonts to be present in its resources folder. Due to licensing
    issues, these cannot be distributed together with TaskCollect and must be
    downloaded manually.

OPTIONS

          8080 and all connections will be insecure. For use in development
