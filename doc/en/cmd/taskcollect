NAME
    taskcollect - multiplex functionality from web platforms for students

INVOCATION
    taskcollect

DESCRIPTION
    TaskCollect starts a web server on TCP port 443 which provides a web
    interface for school students. The web interface provides functionality
    essential for student interaction with teacher-assigned resources, tasks,
    etc., communicating with users' schools' web platforms as necessary.

    In order to write to the encrypted user credentials database, TaskCollect
    requests for the passphrase to the database before attempting to start the
    web server.

    TaskCollect requires a Google OAuth 2.0 client ID file in order to
    authenticate to the Google Classroom API. A OAuth 2 client ID may be
    obtained from the Google Cloud Console with a valid Google account.
