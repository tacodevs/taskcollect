COMMANDS                                                             TASKCOLLECT

NAME
    taskcollect - multiplex functionality from web platforms for students

INVOCATION
    taskcollect [-w]

DESCRIPTION
    TaskCollect starts a web server on TCP port 443 which provides a web
    interface for school students. The web interface provides functionality
    essential for student interaction with teacher-assigned resources, tasks,
    etc., communicating with users' schools' web platforms as necessary.

    TaskCollect uses Redis 7 as its user credentials database and will not
    operate without it. To get started, install Redis 7 and set up the Redis
    server with a password. While a password is not necessarily required, it
    is heavily recommended. When setting up the Redis database, no further 
    information needs to be provided, as TaskCollect populates it automatically.
    Upon running TaskCollect, it will prompt you for the password to the Redis 
    database and will attempt to connect to the Redis server. The default
    address is localhost:6379 with a database index of 0, although this can be
    changed in the config.json file. It is very important to note that on the
    server computer, the Redis server MUST NOT BE EXPOSED TO THE NETWORK. The
    Redis server should only be available on localhost for TaskCollect to
    operate.

    TaskCollect requires a Google OAuth 2.0 client ID file in order to
    authenticate to the Google Classroom API. An OAuth 2 client ID may be
    obtained from the Google Cloud Console with a valid Google account. The
    client ID must be made with the permitted access origin set to the server
    URL(s) (e.g. "https://taskcollect.io") and the redirect URL set to the
    server URL(s) with "/gauth" appended (e.g. "https://taskcollect.io/gauth").

    TaskCollect requires two WOFF2 font files, "mainfont.woff2" and "navfont.woff2". 
    The main interface font (mainfont.woff2) is Lato Regular, while the navigation 
    bar font (navbar.woff2) is Red Hat Display Medium. Both of these fonts must be 
    present in the resources folder.
