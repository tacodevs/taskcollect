COMMANDS                                                             TASKCOLLECT

NAME
    taskcollect - multiplex functionality from web platforms for students

INVOCATION
    taskcollect [-w]

DESCRIPTION
    TaskCollect starts a web server on TCP port 443 which provides a web
    interface for school students. The web interface provides functionality
    essential for student interaction with teacher-assigned resources, tasks,
    etc., communicating with users' schools' web platforms as necessary.

    ### Database

    TaskCollect uses Redis 7 as its user credentials database and will not
    operate without it. To get started, install Redis 7 and set up the Redis
    server with a password. While a password is not necessarily required, it
    is heavily recommended. When setting up the Redis database, no further 
    information needs to be provided, as TaskCollect populates it automatically.
    Upon running TaskCollect, it will prompt you for the password to the Redis 
    database and will attempt to connect to the Redis server. The default
    address is localhost:6379 with a database index of 0, although this can be
    changed in the config.json file. It is very important to note that on the
    server computer, the Redis server MUST NOT BE EXPOSED TO THE NETWORK. The
    Redis server should only be available on localhost for TaskCollect to
    operate.

    ### Google API client

    TaskCollect requires a Google OAuth 2.0 client ID file in order to
    authenticate to the Google Classroom API. An OAuth 2 client ID may be
    obtained from the Google Cloud Console with a valid Google account. To do
    so:

      1. Create a new Google Cloud Project for TaskCollect.

      2. Go to the "APIs and Services" page for the new project.

      3. In "APIs and Services -> Credentials" you will need to create an OAuth
         2.0 client ID, which you can download as JSON. This JSON will be
         required as the "gauth.json" file for TaskCollect.

    After that, you will need to go to "APIs and Services -> OAuth consent
    screen" to setup the OAuth consent screen which the user will encounter for
    Google authentication. You will need to use the following data to setup the
    OAuth consent screen:

        App name: TaskCollect

        User support email: ~kvo/taskcollect@lists.sr.ht

        Developer contact information: ~kvo/taskcollect@lists.sr.ht

        Logo: assets/logos/taskcollect-logo-fancy.png (from the TaskCollect
            repository.

        Application home page: https://taskcollect.codeberg.page

        Privacy policy: https://taskcollect.codeberg.page/about/privacy.html

        Terms of use: https://taskcollect.codeberg.page/about/terms.html

        Authorized JavaScript origins: https://taskcollect.io (where
            "taskcollect.io" is the domain of the deployed TaskCollect instance)

        Authorized redirect URLs: https://taskcollect.io/gauth (where
            "taskcollect.io" is the domain of the deployed TaskCollect instance)

    Add the following as authorised scopes:

      * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.announcements.readonly
      * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses.readonly
      * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.me
      * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courseworkmaterials.readonly
      * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.student-submissions.me.readonly

    Once you've set up the OAuth consent page, at the top of "APIs and Services
    -> OAuth consent screen" you should see the "Publishing status" section, in
    which there is a button to "publish app". Click that to make the Google
    Cloud project external.

    ### Fonts

    TaskCollect also requires two WOFF2 font files, "mainfont.woff2" and
    "navfont.woff2". The main interface font (mainfont.woff2) is Lato Regular,
    while the navigation bar font (navbar.woff2) is Red Hat Display Medium. Both
    of these fonts files must be present in the resources folder.

OPTIONS
    -w    Run TaskCollect without TLS support. TaskCollect will start on port
          8080 and all connections will be unencrypted. For personal and
          and development use only. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

ISSUES
    This documentation page is too long, likely as a result of the cumbersome
    dependency on the Google Classroom API and certain design issues in
    TaskCollect.
