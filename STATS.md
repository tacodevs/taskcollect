# Performance statistics

TaskCollect is a piece of software for which performance is important, but may,
for various reasons, not perform well. Unfortunately, the platforms that
TaskCollect multiplexes have poor performance. TaskCollect, which retrieves data
from these platforms, must unfortunately pass this issue onto the user. It
cannot, unfortunately, magically fix the performance issue, which is on the
source platforms' end.

This document collects statistics regarding various aspects of performance in
TaskCollect.
